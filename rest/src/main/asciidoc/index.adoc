Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a note will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{snippets}/api-documentation/get-authors/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/api-documentation/get-authors/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
